Hi there, I built this website as my portfolio so that you can knows more about me and the projects that I working on. You can visit the website at: https://qvd808.github.io/portfolio/


### Built With

<!-- TODO: List any MAJOR libraries/frameworks (e.g. React, Tailwind) with links to their homepages. -->
I used vite as the frame work and React to organize all the pages component together. I also used tailwind for the development process to generate a CSS style for the page. For the animation, I used Framer Motion which is a library distributed by Framer to make the page transition and animation looks cool and smooth. There also more library that I used which I will listed below

- [vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Axios](https://www.axios.com/)

The page used github actions to built the static HTML file and will deploy to a subtree of a github branch using [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) for a quick deployment

The glitch text in the website was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkR5gU-mbKY). I think it very cool so I decided to implement with the same concept but in Framer Motion animation so it looks more smooth.
